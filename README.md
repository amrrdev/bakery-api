Here’s a more creative and fun version for you:

"Please, for the love of all things code, don’t ever use this _ridiculous_ language again. The only valid reasons for using it are if every other programming language has been erased from existence, or if you’re trying to build the world’s most advanced farming simulator. Do yourself a massive favor—ditch it and let’s leave PHP in the past where it belongs!"
